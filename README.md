#Motivation

As an adc player in league of legends I am tired of seeing my role by left in the dust constantly and have had enough. This is my quest to gather concrete data to support my hypothesis.

This is one of the many projects towards this goal and this project will focus on gather role distribution at skilled level of play across multiple regions.

## Getting Started
